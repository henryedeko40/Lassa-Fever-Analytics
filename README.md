# Outbreak vs Post-Outbreak Mortality Patterns in Lassa Fever (Edo State, Nigeria)

## Background
Lassa fever is an endemic viral hemorrhagic disease in Nigeria, with seasonal outbreaks placing significant pressure on health systems in affected states. Edo State remains one of the most affected regions, reporting recurrent outbreaks with varying clinical outcomes.

While outbreak periods often attract heightened surveillance and response efforts, less attention is paid to patient outcomes during post-outbreak periods. Understanding whether mortality patterns differ between outbreak and post-outbreak phases is important for evaluating the consistency of clinical care and identifying gaps in preparedness outside peak transmission periods.

## Objective
To compare mortality outcomes and selected clinical characteristics of Lassa fever patients during outbreak and post-outbreak periods in Edo State, Nigeria.
